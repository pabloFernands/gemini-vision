# Invoice Data Extraction and Google Sheets Integration

## Overview

This application leverages artificial intelligence to extract and organize text from images, specifically designed to process invoices. The app reads text from invoice images and subsequently formats and organizes the extracted text into a table. The final step integrates with Google Sheets to populate a spreadsheet with the organized data.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload invoice images for processing.
- **Text Extraction**: Utilizes AI to read and extract text from the provided images.
- **Data Formatting**: AI-driven formatting and organization of extracted text into a structured table.
- **Google Sheets Integration**: Automatically fills the organized data into a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

## How It Works

1. **Upload Image**: Start by uploading an invoice image to the application.
2. **Extract Text**: The application uses AI technology to read and extract text from the image.
3. **Format Data**: Extracted text is then processed and formatted into a structured table.
4. **Populate Google Sheets**: The formatted data is seamlessly integrated into a Google Sheets spreadsheet, making it easy to manage and analyze.
